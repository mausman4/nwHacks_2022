Zeme, a project for nwHacks 2022

Joint statement:
We decided to tackle an issue that many of us have had to face in recent times; the monotony of online classes. It's probably a familiar feeling, eyes staring at your zoom call but mind at who knows where. Online lectures are not only too long to stay focused throughout, but are dry and lacking interaction.

The angle we decided to take to help ameliorate this was to inject humor into the classroom  (in the form of memes) and encourage more frequent, smaller breaks that can help one's brain to refresh. Zeme is a video conferencing website that embeds an interactive game directly into the client, where participants caption random memes and vote on their favorite. The host is prompted every ~20 minutes to start the game, each lasting only a minute or two. This structure is inspired by the Pomodoro method and is proven to help improve focus 

To build this website, we used Microsoft ACS, MongoDB, React, Node.js and web sockets.
